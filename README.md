# Raspberry-NicheKiosk

This is a collection of scripts to setup our Pi kiosk screens.

The main script kiosk_setup will guide you though the setup of the needed values for the kiosk screen. The scripts can also be run individually if needed.

Right now the set_ip and autostart should only be runned onces, otherwise you will add unnessesary lines in files.

# Raspberry-NicheKiosk

This is a collection of scripts to setup our Pi kiosk screens.

1: Start the Pi

2: Open Terminal and run this command: git clone https://github.com/mv-frhavn/Raspberry-NicheKiosk

3: Run this command as the next one in terminal: sudo sh Raspberry-NicheKiosk/kiosk_setup.sh

4: Follow the terminal and the install is done


Download the scripts to the /home/pi folder and sh run it.
The main script kiosk_setup will guide you though the setup of the needed values for the kiosk screen. The scripts can also be run individually if needed.

Right now the set_ip and autostart should only be runned onces, otherwise you will add unnessesary lines in files.
